  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour describing the transport layer used to communicate with the Claude CLI.

  A transport is responsible for starting and supervising the underlying connection,
  forwarding JSON control/data frames to the CLI, broadcasting replies to subscribers,
  and shutting down cleanly when the client stops.

  Implementations should be OTP-friendly processes (typically a `GenServer`)
  that encapsulate any state required to maintain the connection.

  Signals end of input stream to the CLI process.

  This closes stdin to indicate no more input will be sent. Required for
  non-streaming queries where the CLI waits for stdin to close before
  processing.

  ## Implementation Notes

  - For Port-based transports: Close the stdin pipe
  - For erlexec-based transports: Send `:eof` signal
  - This callback is optional - transports may not support it
