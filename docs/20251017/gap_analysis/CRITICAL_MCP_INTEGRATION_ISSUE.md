# CRITICAL: MCP Tool System Integration Flaw

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Severity:** HIGH - Feature is incomplete and non-functional
**Status:** BLOCKING for production use of SDK MCP tools

---

## Problem Statement

The MCP Tool System implementation (v0.4.0) has a **critical architectural flaw**: SDK MCP servers cannot actually be used with the Claude CLI because there is no integration layer to handle in-process tool execution.

### What We Built

✅ **Working Components:**
1. `deftool` macro - Creates tool modules successfully
2. `Tool.Registry` GenServer - Registers and manages tools
3. `create_sdk_mcp_server/1` - Creates server configurations
4. Tool execution - Tools can be called directly (e.g., `MyTool.execute(%{...})`)
5. Tool metadata - `__tool_metadata__/0` generated correctly
6. **42 passing tests** - All test infrastructure works

❌ **Missing Critical Component:**
- **NO integration with Claude CLI** - SDK servers cannot actually be used in queries
- **NO tool call interception** - Client doesn't intercept tool_use requests
- **NO tool execution routing** - No code routes Claude's tool requests to SDK tools
- **NO control protocol for tool calls** - Missing tool call/result protocol handling

### What Doesn't Work

```elixir
# This compiles and creates the server successfully:
server = ClaudeAgentSDK.create_sdk_mcp_server(
  name: "math-tools",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: [MathTools.Add]
)

# This creates Options successfully:
options = Options.new(
  mcp_config: %{"math-tools" => server}
)

# But THIS CRASHES when trying to start Claude CLI:
ClaudeAgentSDK.query("Use math tools", options)
# Error: FunctionClauseError - shell_escape expects string, got map

# Because Options.to_args tries to pass the server MAP to CLI args
# CLI expects --mcp-config to be a FILE PATH, not a map
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Type Mismatch:**
   - `Options.mcp_config` is typed as `String.t()` (path to config file)
   - We're storing `%{name: server_map}` (map of servers)
   - `add_mcp_config_args` tries to pass this map as `--mcp-config` arg
   - `shell_escape` receives map instead of string → crash

2. **Missing Integration Layer:**
   - Python SDK has tool execution in `_internal/query.py`
   - Python intercepts `tool_use` blocks from Claude
   - Python routes to SDK tools if type is `:sdk`
   - Python never passes SDK servers to CLI (they're in-process)

3. **Test Coverage Gap:**
   - Tests create SDK servers ✅
   - Tests register tools ✅
   - Tests execute tools directly ✅
   - **Tests NEVER actually use servers with Client or query** ❌
   - Tests only verify data structures, not integration

### Why Tests Pass

The tests are testing the **wrong thing**:

```elixir
# This test passes:
test "accepts SDK server in mcp_servers option" do
  server = create_sdk_mcp_server(...)
  options = %Options{mcp_config: %{"calc" => server}}

  # Only checks that Options can HOLD the value
  assert options.mcp_config["calc"].type == :sdk
  # Does NOT test that it works with Client or query!
end
```

**None of the SDK MCP tests actually call:**
- `Client.start_link(options)` with SDK servers
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.query(prompt, options)` with SDK servers
- Any real integration with the CLI subprocess

---

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: HIGH

**What works:**
- Tool definition (deftool macro)
- Tool registration
- Direct tool execution
- Tool discovery

**What doesn't work:**
- Using SDK tools with Claude queries ❌
- Passing SDK servers to Claude ❌
- Claude invoking SDK tools ❌
- **The entire purpose of the feature** ❌

### User Impact

Users who try to use SDK MCP servers will get:
1. Compilation errors or crashes when starting queries
2. No way to actually provide tools to Claude
3. Confusion about how to use the feature
4. **Complete feature non-functionality**

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (v0.4.1 Hotfix)

**Option A: Document as Incomplete (1 hour)**
1. Add WARNING to README about SDK MCP servers
2. Mark feature as "Experimental - CLI integration pending"
3. Update CHANGELOG to note limitation
4. Provide workaround using external MCP servers only
5. Remove live example that doesn't work

**Option B: Disable Feature (2 hours)**
1. Remove SDK MCP functionality from v0.4.0
2. Revert to v0.3.0 feature set
3. Move SDK MCP to experimental branch
4. Release v0.4.0 with only Agents + Permissions (90% parity)

### Proper Fix (v0.5.0 - Estimated 1-2 weeks)

**Design Changes Required:**

#### 1. Separate MCP Config Types (2-3 days)

```elixir
# Current (broken):
@type mcp_config :: String.t() | nil  # Path to file

# Fixed:
@type mcp_server :: sdk_server() | external_server()
@type sdk_server :: %{
  type: :sdk,
  name: String.t(),
  version: String.t(),
  registry_pid: pid()
}
@type external_server :: %{
  type: :stdio | :sse | :http,
  command: String.t(),
  args: [String.t()]
}
@type mcp_config :: %{String.t() => mcp_server()} | String.t() | nil

# Options handling:
defstruct [
  # ... other fields
  mcp_servers: %{String.t() => mcp_server()} | nil,  # NEW: Server map
  mcp_config: String.t() | nil,  # Keep for external config files
  # ...
]
```

#### 2. Tool Call Interception in Client (3-4 days)

```elixir
# In Client.handle_decoded_message when receiving tool_use:

defp handle_decoded_message(:sdk_message, %{"type" => "assistant", "content" => content}, state) do
  # Check for tool_use blocks
  tool_uses = Enum.filter(content, &(&1["type"] == "tool_use"))

  for tool_use <- tool_uses do
    tool_name = String.to_atom(tool_use["name"])
    tool_input = tool_use["input"]
    tool_id = tool_use["id"]

    # Check if this is an SDK tool
    case find_sdk_tool(state.options.mcp_servers, tool_name) do
      {:ok, server, tool_module} ->
        # Execute in-process
        result = execute_sdk_tool(tool_module, tool_input)
        # Send tool_result back to Claude via control protocol
        send_tool_result(state.port, tool_id, result)

      :not_found ->
        # Let Claude CLI handle it (external MCP server)
        :ok
    end
  end

  # Continue normal message broadcasting
  broadcast_message(msg, state)
  state
end
```

#### 3. Control Protocol Extension (2-3 days)

Add tool execution protocol messages:

```elixir
# Send tool result to CLI:
defp send_tool_result(port, tool_id, result) do
  message = %{
    "type" => "control_request",
    "request" => %{
      "subtype" => "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id" => tool_id,
      "result" => result
    }
  }

  Port.command(port, Jason.encode!(message) <> "\n")
end
```

#### 4. Options Refactoring (1-2 days)

```elixir
defp build_cli_args(options) do
  args = []

  # Handle external MCP servers (file path or stdio servers)
  args = add_external_mcp_args(args, options)

  # SDK servers are NOT passed to CLI - they're handled in-process
  # (no CLI args needed for SDK servers)

  args
end

defp add_external_mcp_args(args, %{mcp_config: path}) when is_binary(path) do
  args ++ ["--mcp-config", path]
end

defp add_external_mcp_args(args, %{mcp_servers: servers}) when is_map(servers) do
  # Filter for external servers only
  external = Enum.filter(servers, fn {_name, server} -> server.type != :sdk end)

  if external == [] do
    args
  else
    # Convert external servers to temp config file or pass individually
    # ...implementation
  end
end

defp add_external_mcp_args(args, _), do: args
```

#### 5. Integration Tests (1 week)

**Real integration tests needed:**

```elixir
test "SDK MCP tool is invoked by Claude during query" do
  # Define tool
  defmodule TestTool do
    use ClaudeAgentSDK.Tool

    deftool :test, "Test tool", %{type: "object"} do
      def execute(_) do
        send self(), :tool_executed  # Signal execution
        {:ok, %{"content" => [%{"type" => "text", "text" => "done"}]}}
      end
    end
  end

  server = create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name: "test",
    version: "1.0.0",
    tools: [TestTool.Test]
  )

  options = Options.new(
    mcp_servers: %{"test" => server},
    max_turns: 3
  )

  # This should actually work:
  messages = ClaudeAgentSDK.query("Use the test tool", options)
  |> Enum.to_list()

  # Verify tool was actually executed
  assert_received :tool_executed

  # Verify Claude got the result
  assert Enum.any?(messages, fn msg ->
    msg["type"] == "assistant" &&
    has_tool_result_content?(msg)
  end)
end
```

## Comparison with Python SDK

### Python SDK Architecture (Working)

```python
# Python SDK flow:
1. User creates SDK MCP server with @tool decorator
2. Server stored in options.mcp_servers (NOT passed to CLI)
3. Query starts, CLI subprocess started (WITHOUT SDK servers in args)
4. Claude asks to use a tool (sends tool_use message)
5. Python SDK intercepts tool_use message
6. Python checks: is this an SDK tool or external MCP tool?
7. If SDK: Execute in-process, send result back to Claude
8. If external: CLI handles it via MCP protocol
9. Continue conversation with tool results
```

**Key files in Python:**
- `src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/query.py` - Tool execution logic
- `src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/client.py` - Message interception
- Lines handling SDK vs external tool routing

### Elixir SDK Current State (Broken)

```elixir
# Elixir SDK current flow:
1. User creates SDK MCP server ✅
2. Server stored in options.mcp_config (type is String.t() not map!) ❌
3. Query tries to start CLI
4. Options.to_args tries to convert mcp_config to CLI args
5. shell_escape receives MAP instead of STRING
6. CRASH: FunctionClauseError ❌

# Missing:
- No tool_use message interception
- No SDK vs external tool routing
- No in-process tool execution during queries
- No tool_result sending back to CLI
```

---

## Recommended Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (v0.4.1 - 1 day)

**1. Fix Type System**
- Change `mcp_config` type from `String.t()` to allow maps
- OR add separate `mcp_servers` field for SDK servers
- Update `shell_escape` to handle or skip non-string values

**2. Update Documentation**
```markdown
## MCP Tool System (v0.4.0) - ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL

SDK MCP tools are currently **not integrated with Claude CLI**.

**What works:**
- Tool definition with deftool macro
- Direct tool execution
- Tool registration and discovery

**What doesn't work yet (coming in v0.5.0):**
- Passing SDK tools to Claude queries
- Claude invoking SDK tools during conversations
- Tool call interception and routing

**Workaround:**
Use external MCP servers (stdio/sse) or wait for v0.5.0.
```

**3. Update Tests**
- Add integration tests that actually use Client with SDK servers
- Make tests fail properly to catch this issue
- Add explicit "not yet implemented" skips for integration

### Phase 2: Full Implementation (v0.5.0 - 1-2 weeks)

**Week 1: Core Integration**
- Implement tool_use message interception in Client
- Add SDK tool routing logic
- Implement in-process tool execution
- Send tool_result back to CLI via control protocol

**Week 2: Testing & Polish**
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Live examples that actually work
- Performance testing
- Documentation updates

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Test Gaps

**What we test:**
- ✅ Tool macro expansion
- ✅ Tool module generation
- ✅ Tool metadata
- ✅ Direct tool execution
- ✅ Registry management
- ✅ Server creation

**What we DON'T test:**
- ❌ Client.start_link with SDK servers
- ❌ query/2 with SDK servers
- ❌ Tool interception during conversations
- ❌ Tool results sent back to Claude
- ❌ End-to-end SDK tool usage
- ❌ Integration with actual CLI subprocess

### How This Passed Review

1. **Tests are isolated** - Each component tested separately
2. **No integration tests** - Never tested components together
3. **Struct validation only** - Tests check data structures, not behavior
4. **Mocking hides issues** - Mock mode doesn't exercise CLI integration
5. **TDD focus on units** - Focused on individual functions, not system integration

**Example of misleading test:**
```elixir
test "accepts SDK server in mcp_servers option" do
  server = create_sdk_mcp_server(...)
  options = %Options{mcp_config: %{"calc" => server}}

  # This passes:
  assert options.mcp_config["calc"].type == :sdk

  # But this was never tested:
  # {:ok, client} = Client.start_link(options)  # Would crash!
  # ClaudeAgentSDK.query("test", options)       # Would crash!
end
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Assumed API compatibility** - Copied Python API without understanding internals
2. **Insufficient integration testing** - Unit tests passed but system doesn't work
3. **Type system too loose** - Options.mcp_config accepts any value
4. **No end-to-end validation** - Never ran a complete workflow
5. **Test-driven but not behavior-driven** - Tests verified structure, not functionality

### What Should Have Been Done

1. **Study Python implementation first** - Understand the tool execution flow
2. **Write integration test first** - Test the COMPLETE workflow
3. **Make integration test fail** - Prove the integration doesn't work
4. **Implement integration layer** - Build the missing pieces
5. **Make integration test pass** - Verify it actually works

### Correct TDD for This Feature

```elixir
# SHOULD HAVE STARTED HERE (Integration Test):
test "SDK tool is invoked by Claude during query" do
  # This test would have FAILED immediately
  # Exposing the missing integration layer

  server = create_sdk_mcp_server(...)
  options = Options.new(mcp_servers: %{"test" => server})

  # This should work but doesn't:
  result = ClaudeAgentSDK.query("use test tool", options)
  |> Enum.to_list()

  # Would have crashed, revealing the gap
end
```

Instead we wrote 42 unit tests for components without testing if they work together.

## Fix Options

### Option 1: Quick Hack (2-3 days) - NOT RECOMMENDED

Intercept tool_use messages and execute SDK tools inline, send results back.

**Pros:**
- Fast to implement
- Gets basic functionality working

**Cons:**
- Fragile integration
- Doesn't handle all edge cases
- May have race conditions
- Hard to maintain

### Option 2: Proper Implementation (1-2 weeks) - RECOMMENDED

Follow Python SDK architecture exactly:

1. **Separate MCP server types**
   - `Options.mcp_servers` for SDK servers (map)
   - `Options.mcp_config` for external config (string path)
   - Update type specs properly

2. **Client message interception**
   - Intercept ALL assistant messages
   - Check for tool_use blocks
   - Route SDK tools to in-process execution
   - Route external tools to CLI handling

3. **Control protocol extension**
   - Add tool_result request type
   - Send results back to CLI
   - Handle async tool execution
   - Timeout protection

4. **Comprehensive integration tests**
   - Test actual Claude → SDK tool → result flow
   - Test mixed SDK + external servers
   - Test error handling
   - Test concurrent tool calls

5. **Performance considerations**
   - Tool execution in separate Task
   - Timeout handling (tools that hang)
   - Error isolation (tool crashes shouldn't crash client)

### Option 3: Defer to v0.5.0 (HONEST) - ALSO RECOMMENDED

1. **Acknowledge the gap** in v0.4.0 release notes
2. **Document as "Partial Implementation"**
3. **Keep the infrastructure** (it's not wasted - it's 70% done)
4. **Plan proper completion** for v0.5.0
5. **Focus v0.4.0 on** Agents + Permissions (which DO work)

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Update v0.4.0 documentation** with clear warnings:
   ```markdown
   ## MCP Tool System (v0.4.0) - ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION

   **Status:** Infrastructure complete, CLI integration pending

   **What works:**
   - deftool macro for defining tools ✅
   - Tool registration and discovery ✅
   - Direct tool execution ✅

   **What doesn't work yet:**
   - Using SDK tools in Claude queries ❌
   - Integration with Claude CLI ❌
   - Tool call routing ❌

   **Workaround:** Use external MCP servers (--mcp-config path/to/config.json)

   **Timeline:** Full integration coming in v0.5.0 (ETA: 2 weeks)
   ```

2. **Remove broken live example**
   - mcp_tools_live.exs doesn't work, remove it
   - Keep mcp_calculator_tool.exs (shows direct execution)

3. **Update CHANGELOG** to note limitation

4. **Adjust feature parity claim**
   - Change from "95% parity" to "85% parity"
   - Or clarify "95% parity excluding MCP tool integration"

### Short-term (v0.5.0 - 2 weeks)

1. **Implement proper integration** following Python SDK
2. **Add real integration tests**
3. **Update examples** to show working integration
4. **Achieve true 95% parity**

---

## Testing Requirements for v0.5.0

### Integration Tests That Must Pass

```elixir
describe "SDK MCP integration (end-to-end)" do
  test "Claude invokes SDK tool and receives result" do
    # Full workflow test
  end

  test "multiple SDK tools in one conversation" do
    # Sequential tool calls
  end

  test "mixed SDK and external tools" do
    # Both types working together
  end

  test "SDK tool errors handled gracefully" do
    # Tool crashes don't crash client
  end

  test "SDK tool timeouts handled" do
    # Hanging tools don't block forever
  end
end
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start query with SDK MCP server
- [ ] Claude asks to use SDK tool
- [ ] Tool executes in Elixir process
- [ ] Result sent back to Claude
- [ ] Claude continues conversation with result
- [ ] Works with multiple tools
- [ ] Works with tool errors
- [ ] Works alongside external MCP servers

---

## Conclusion

The MCP Tool System has **excellent infrastructure** (macros, registry, tool execution) but **no integration with Claude CLI**. This is a **critical gap** that makes the feature currently non-functional for real use.

**Recommendation: Be honest about the limitation, plan proper fix for v0.5.0**

### v0.4.0 Should Claim:
- ✅ Agent Definitions (100% complete and working)
- ✅ Permission System (100% complete and working)
- ⚠️ MCP Tool System (70% complete - infrastructure only)
- **Overall: 85% feature parity** (not 95%)

### v0.5.0 Will Add:
- MCP Tool System CLI integration (complete the remaining 30%)
- Transport abstraction
- Additional runtime controls
- **Achieve true 95%+ parity**

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Document the limitation honestly
2. Remove broken examples
3. Plan v0.5.0 implementation
4. Learn from this for future features (integration tests first!)
