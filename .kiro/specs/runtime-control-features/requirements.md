# Requirements Document: Runtime Control Features

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of runtime control features for the Claude Agent SDK for Elixir to achieve 100% feature parity with the Python SDK. Based on the critical assessment, we need to implement two missing features: runtime model switching and transport layer abstraction.

## Glossary

- **Client**: The `ClaudeAgentSDK.Client` GenServer that maintains a bidirectional connection to the Claude CLI
- **Runtime Control**: The ability to modify configuration parameters during an active session without restarting the client
- **Model**: The Claude AI model being used (e.g., "claude-opus-4", "claude-sonnet-4", "claude-haiku-4")
- **Transport**: The communication layer between the Elixir SDK and the Claude CLI process
- **Control Protocol**: The bidirectional JSON-RPC protocol used for communication between the SDK and CLI
- **Session**: An active conversation context maintained by the Client GenServer
- **Port**: Erlang's built-in mechanism for subprocess communication via stdin/stdout

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Runtime Model Switching

**User Story:** As a developer using the Claude Agent SDK, I want to switch the AI model during an active conversation, so that I can optimize for different tasks without restarting the client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Client GenServer is running, THE Client SHALL provide a `set_model/2` function that accepts a model name
2. WHEN `set_model/2` is called with a valid model name, THE Client SHALL send a control protocol message to the CLI to change the model
3. WHEN the model change is successful, THE Client SHALL update its internal state with the new model
4. WHEN the model change is successful, THE Client SHALL return `:ok` to the caller
5. WHEN the model change fails, THE Client SHALL return `{:error, reason}` with a descriptive error message
6. WHEN `set_model/2` is called with an invalid model name, THE Client SHALL validate the model name and return `{:error, :invalid_model}`
7. WHEN the model is changed, THE Client SHALL preserve the existing conversation context
8. WHEN `get_model/1` is called, THE Client SHALL return the currently active model name

### Requirement 2: Model Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK to validate model names before sending them to the CLI, so that I receive immediate feedback on invalid configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model name is provided, THE SDK SHALL validate it against a list of known model names
2. WHEN a model name matches a short form (e.g., "opus", "sonnet", "haiku"), THE SDK SHALL accept it as valid
3. WHEN a model name matches a full form (e.g., "claude-opus-4-20250514"), THE SDK SHALL accept it as valid
4. WHEN a model name is invalid, THE SDK SHALL return `{:error, :invalid_model}` with suggestions for valid models
5. WHEN a model name is valid, THE SDK SHALL normalize it to the CLI-expected format

### Requirement 3: Transport Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK to support pluggable transport mechanisms, so that I can extend the SDK to work with different communication protocols beyond Erlang Ports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SDK SHALL define a `ClaudeAgentSDK.Transport` behaviour with standardized callbacks
2. THE Transport behaviour SHALL define a `start_link/1` callback for initializing the transport
3. THE Transport behaviour SHALL define a `send/2` callback for sending messages to the CLI
4. THE Transport behaviour SHALL define a `receive/1` callback for receiving messages from the CLI
5. THE Transport behaviour SHALL define a `close/1` callback for cleanup
6. THE SDK SHALL provide a `ClaudeAgentSDK.Transport.Port` implementation as the default transport
7. WHEN the Client starts, THE Client SHALL accept a `:transport` option specifying which transport to use
8. WHEN no transport is specified, THE Client SHALL default to `ClaudeAgentSDK.Transport.Port`
9. THE Port transport SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 4: Transport Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom transports with their own options, so that I can adapt the SDK to different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom transport is specified, THE Client SHALL pass transport-specific options to the transport's `start_link/1` callback
2. THE Transport behaviour SHALL define a `@type transport_opts` for transport-specific configuration
3. WHEN a transport fails to start, THE Client SHALL return `{:error, {:transport_failed, reason}}`
4. WHEN a transport connection is lost, THE Client SHALL notify subscribers with an error message
5. THE SDK SHALL provide documentation for implementing custom transports

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing SDK user, I want all my current code to continue working without modifications, so that I can upgrade to the new version without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no transport is specified in Options, THE Client SHALL use the Port transport by default
2. WHEN existing code calls `Client.start_link/1` without transport options, THE Client SHALL behave identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN the Port transport is used, THE Client SHALL maintain all existing error handling behavior
4. WHEN the Port transport is used, THE Client SHALL maintain all existing message parsing behavior
5. THE SDK SHALL not introduce any breaking changes to the public API

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for runtime control operations, so that I can gracefully handle failures and provide good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `set_model/2` times out after 30 seconds, THE Client SHALL return `{:error, :timeout}`
2. WHEN the CLI rejects a model change, THE Client SHALL return `{:error, {:cli_error, message}}`
3. WHEN a transport send operation fails, THE Client SHALL return `{:error, {:transport_error, reason}}`
4. WHEN a transport receive operation fails, THE Client SHALL log the error and attempt recovery
5. THE SDK SHALL provide clear error messages for all failure scenarios

### Requirement 7: Test-Driven Development Process

**User Story:** As a developer following TDD, I want to write tests before implementation, so that I ensure correct behavior and achieve high code coverage from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any feature, THE developer SHALL write failing tests first (Red phase)
2. WHEN tests are written, THE developer SHALL verify they fail for the right reasons
3. WHEN tests fail correctly, THE developer SHALL implement minimal code to make tests pass (Green phase)
4. WHEN tests pass, THE developer SHALL refactor code while keeping tests green (Refactor phase)
5. WHEN refactoring, THE developer SHALL verify test coverage remains above 95%
6. THE SDK SHALL provide unit tests for `set_model/2` covering success and failure cases
7. THE SDK SHALL provide unit tests for model validation
8. THE SDK SHALL provide unit tests for the Transport behaviour and Port implementation
9. THE SDK SHALL provide integration tests demonstrating model switching during a conversation
10. WHEN writing tests, THE developer SHALL use descriptive test names following "should_<behavior>_when_<condition>" pattern
11. WHEN writing tests, THE developer SHALL test one behavior per test case
12. THE SDK SHALL achieve >95% test coverage for all new code before considering implementation complete

### Requirement 8: Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for runtime control features, so that I can confidently use these features in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SDK SHALL provide documentation with examples for runtime model switching
2. THE SDK SHALL provide documentation with examples for implementing custom transports
3. THE SDK SHALL update the README with runtime control features
4. THE SDK SHALL update the PYTHON_SDK_COMPARISON.md to reflect 100% feature parity

### Requirement 9: Control Protocol Extensions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the control protocol to support model switching commands, so that the CLI can process model change requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Protocol module SHALL define an `encode_set_model_request/2` function
2. WHEN encoding a set model request, THE Protocol SHALL create a control request with subtype "set_model"
3. THE Protocol SHALL include the model name in the request payload
4. THE Protocol SHALL generate a unique request ID for tracking
5. WHEN the CLI responds to a set model request, THE Protocol SHALL decode the response
6. THE Protocol SHALL handle both success and error responses for model changes

### Requirement 10: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want runtime control operations to be fast and efficient, so that they don't introduce noticeable latency in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `set_model/2` is called, THE operation SHALL complete within 100ms under normal conditions
2. THE Transport abstraction SHALL introduce less than 5% overhead compared to direct Port usage
3. WHEN switching models, THE Client SHALL not interrupt ongoing message streaming
4. THE Client SHALL queue model change requests if a message is currently being processed
5. THE SDK SHALL use efficient message passing patterns to minimize latency

### Requirement 11: Observability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visibility into runtime control operations, so that I can debug issues and monitor system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `set_model/2` is called, THE Client SHALL log the model change request at debug level
2. WHEN a model change succeeds, THE Client SHALL log the success at info level
3. WHEN a model change fails, THE Client SHALL log the failure at error level with details
4. WHEN a transport error occurs, THE Client SHALL log the error with context
5. THE SDK SHALL provide telemetry events for model changes (if telemetry is available)
